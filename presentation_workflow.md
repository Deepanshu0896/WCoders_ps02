## 👨‍💼 Member 1: The Problem & The Vision (Introduction)
**Focus:** Hook the audience, explain *why* this exists.

*   **"Good morning/afternoon judges. We are Team [Team Name], and we are here to solve a problem every student faces: Fragmentation."**
*   **The Problem:**
    *   "On campus, students struggle to find peers with similar skills for projects."
    *   "Study groups are disorganized, and finding an empty seminar hall or lab is a guessing game."
    *   "Existing solutions? Scattered WhatsApp groups and notice boards."
*   **The Solution - PeerSync:**
    *   "PeerSync is a centralized platform to **optimize student collaboration and campus resource usage**."
    *   "We connect students based on skills, sync their free time automatically, and manage campus resources in real-time."

## 👩‍💻 Member 2: The Tech Stack & User Onboarding
**Focus:** Technical foundation and the first user impression.

*   **"Let's dive into how we built this. PeerSync is powered by the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React/Vanilla JS, Node.js)."**
*   **Security:**
    *   "We take security seriously. Passwords are hashed with **Bcrypt**, and every session is protected by **JWT Authentication**."
*   **Live Demo (Screen: Login & Dashboard):**
    *   "Here is our **Smart Dashboard**. It's not just a static page."
    *   "It gives you a live snapshot: Who is free *right now*? What groups are meeting *soon*?"
    *   "We also have a 'Live Availability' toggle. One click, and your peers know you're open to collaborate."

## 👨‍🔧 Member 3: The "Wow" Factor (AI Matching & Groups)
**Focus:** The core innovation and algorithm.

*   **"The heart of PeerSync is our AI-driven Recommendation Engine."**
*   **The 35-Point Algorithm:**
    *   "We don't just match randomly. We use a weighted system:
        *   **15 Points** for Shared Skills.
        *   **10 Points** for Shared Interests.
        *   **5 Points** each for Branch and Year."
*   **Live Demo (Screen: Find Peers/Groups):**
    *   "See this 'Recommended Peers' section? These aren't random. The system analyzed my profile and found the perfect study partners."
    *   "I can also create a **Study Group**. I set the topic, time, and location. Users get notified, and they can join instantly. It cuts down the coordination chaos."

## 👩‍🔬 Member 4: Resource Management & Future Scope
**Focus:** Utility features and closing the pitch.

*   **"Beyond people, we optimize places."**
*   **Live Demo (Screen: Resources):**
    *   "This is our **Resource Manager**. Admin can mark labs or halls as 'Occupied' or 'Available'."
    *   "Students can book a standard 2-hour slot instantly. No more walking to the library just to find it full."
*   **My Schedule Sync:**
    *   "We also integrated a personalized timetable. The system knows when you have class and when you're free, automating your availability status."
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   "PeerSync isn't just an app; it's a productivity ecosystem for campuses."
    *   "Thank you. We are now open for questions!"
